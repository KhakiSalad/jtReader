    7.2.2.1.2.1 Vertex Shape LOD Data

    Vertex Shape LOD Data collection is an abstract container for geometric primitives such as triangle strips, line
    strips, or points, depending on the specific type of Vertex Shape. The set of primitives are further partitioned
    into so-called "face groups." The Vertex Shape LOD Data also contains the vertex attribute bindings and quantization
    settings used to store the vertex records referenced by the primitives.

    One use for face groups is to establish a correspondence between Brep faces and their triangle representation.
    A convention for mapping JTBrep and XTBrep faces to face groups is described in section 9.10 Brep Face Group
    Associations.
